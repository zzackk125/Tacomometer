# Default Assets Backup

This folder contains the default generated C arrays for the Tacomometer. 

## Purpose
These files serve as a restore point. If you modify the `assets/` folder or run `scripts/generate_assets.py` and are unhappy with the results, you can copy these files back into the `src/` directory to restore the original look and feel.

DO NOT DELETE THIS FOLDER.
